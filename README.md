Alarm Clock with GUI in Python
This is not a wonder that an alarm clock has always been useful to warn us while we sleep, take a brief nap, or remind us about some important days that we might forget.

An alarm clock is a clock that is created in order to alert us at a specified time. The primary function of these clocks is to awaken people from their night's sleep or short naps; they are sometimes used for other reminders.
